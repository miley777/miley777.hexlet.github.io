        <h1>Japanese language</h1>
        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>Japanese language, a language isolate <span>(i.e., a language unrelated to any other language)</span> and one of the world’s major languages, with more than 127 million speakers in the early 21st century.</p>
        <p>It is primarily spoken throughout the Japanese archipelago; there are also some <span class="resp">1.5 million Japanese immigrants and their descendants living abroad</span>, mainly in North and South America, who have varying degrees of proficiency in Japanese.</p>
        <p>Since the <em>mid-20th</em> century, no nation other than   <i>Japan</i> has used Japanese as a first or a second language.</p>
        <p>Japanese is the only major language whose genetic affiliation   <span>is not known</span>.  The hypothesis relating Japanese to Korean remains the strongest, but other hypotheses also have been advanced.</p>
        
        <h2 class="imp_title">Some attempt to relate Japanese to the language groups of South Asia such as:</h2>
        <ul class="imp">
            <li>the Austronesian family</li>
            <li>the Austroasiatic family</li>
            <li>the Tibeto-Burman family of the Sino-Tibetan languages</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="faith">Beginning in the second half of the 20th century, efforts were focused more on the origins of the Japanese language than on its genetic affiliation per se; specifically, linguists attempted to reconcile some conflicting linguistic traits.</p>
